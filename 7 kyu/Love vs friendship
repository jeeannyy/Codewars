/* DESCRIPTION:
Ifã€€a = 1, b = 2, c = 3 ... z = 26

Then l + o + v + e = 54

and f + r + i + e + n + d + s + h + i + p = 108

Your task is to write a function which calculates the value of a word based off the sum of the alphabet positions of its characters.

The input will always be made of only lowercase letters and will never be empty.*/


/* Examples:
wordsToMarks("family") => 66
/*


function wordsToMarks(str){

  let sum = 0;
  
  for (let i = 0; i < str.length; i++){
    sum += str.charCodeAt(i) - 96;
  }
  return sum;
}
